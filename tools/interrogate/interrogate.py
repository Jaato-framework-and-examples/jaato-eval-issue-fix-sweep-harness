"""Wake a FINISHED session and ask it to account for something, in prose.

The cascade driver resumes a session to advance a goal. This does the opposite:
it revives a session whose goal is already `finished` and asks a question about
what it did, capturing the answer as text rather than as a completion payload.

Why it is a separate harness and not a driver flag: the driver's job is to
carry a goal forward, and every line of it assumes the next turn advances that
goal. Interrogation has no goal, no due row, no ceiling to enforce — it wants
one turn and one answer. Bolting it onto the driver would put a reviewer's
question inside the machinery that decides whether work is done.

What it is for: run 37 produced a CORRECT one-line fix and a REPORT.md whose
"Root Cause" quoted code that was never in the file. The completion validator
could confirm the suite passed and the report existed; it cannot confirm the
report is true. So the question is whether the session, resumed, can account
for the discrepancy — which is also a test of whether same-session resume
preserves enough to make that possible.

The question travels through `session.wake`, so the daemon wraps it as
untrusted content: the agent reads it as data, not as an instruction from its
operator. That is the same channel the driver uses, and the same caveat applies
— what obliges the agent to answer at all is its persona, not this text.

HOW A TURN ENDS, which is the one thing to get right. The session answers under
ITS OWN completion contract — `session.wake` revives a session with the profile
it was created under, and an interrogator cannot impose a different one. So a
session whose contract demands goal artifacts (a patch path, a report) will
answer your question and then fight its own processor trying to finish.

Two ways round it, and both are legitimate:

* Ask it to end the turn `suspended` rather than `finished`. It is not
  completing a goal, only pausing again, so this is also the honest outcome.
  Works with any two-branch profile and needs no new configuration. The
  question template in this directory does exactly that.
* Create the session under `profiles/interrogator.yaml`, whose contract asks
  for nothing but an answer. Only possible when you decide before the session
  exists that you will want to question it.

Usage:
    interrogate.py <session_id> <workspace> <env_file> <question-file> [config_root]

# Unmodified.  Kept here because interrogating a finished arm is part of
# reviewing a sweep, and a harness that cannot ask its own arms what they did
# is missing half the evidence — see tools/README.md for when that is worth
# doing and what it costs.  Re-copy from the source rather than diverging.
